Project Overview
Welcome to the Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction Model project! This project aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of heart attacks by identifying critical predictors and utilizing advanced machine learning models. By understanding key risk factors and patterns, this project seeks to improve early detection and preventive care.

Key Features
Data Analysis: Conducts comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover risk factors and patterns.

Feature Engineering: Develops new features to capture more information and enhance model accuracy.

Model Building: Implements various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to identify the best-performing model.

Visualization: Provides clear visualizations to interpret risk factors and model results effectively.

Project Structure
Data: Contains the dataset and preprocessing scripts.

Notebooks: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

Models: Stores trained models and related scripts.

Reports: Provides detailed reports on findings and model performances.

Visualizations: Contains visualizations that help interpret the data and model results.
